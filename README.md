# Arduino-controlled light and sound effects for the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 (Revell - 1/600) plastic model

Content:
- enterprise_sketch.ino: Arduino/C++ code. Must be uploaded to an Arduino board (Arduino Nano in this case).
- circuit_schematics.pdf: schematics to build the circuit.
- mp3 folder: sound files played by the DFPlayer Mini sound module must be placed in this folder and uploaded to the player's microSD card.

A build log of the plastic model can be found (in brazilian Portuguese) on this forum: http://forum.plastibrasil.com/viewtopic.php?f=221&t=10837
